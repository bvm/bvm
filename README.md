# gvm - Global Version Manager

A version manager for all binaries.

## Install

Distribution is only available via cargo at the moment, but this project will be released as a single binary in the future.

- `cargo install gvm`

## Why?

I couldn't find a solution like this that also worked on Windows.

## Status

I hacked this together in one night as a proof of concept.
